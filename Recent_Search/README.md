# Sample code

This repository contains sample applications inspired by the [quick start guides](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/recent-search/quick-start). The scripts included in this folder allow you to:

1. Obtain a Bearer token
1. Get the 10 most recent results for the query specified

`recent_search.js`, `recent_search.py` and `recent_search.rb` allow you to run the above flow in JavaScript, Python and Ruby for Recent search.

## Authentication

In order to successfully run the scripts, you must add your Twitter application credentials at the top of each file, where indicated. Remember to remove these credentials when done.
