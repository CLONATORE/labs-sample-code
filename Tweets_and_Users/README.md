# Sample code
This repository also contains two sample applications inspired by the [quick start guides](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/quick-starts). `get_users_sample.py` allows you to enter in a username, and it will return the location and bio for a user. `get_tweets_sample.py` allows you to enter in a tweet id and it will tell you how many likes and retweets a tweet had.

We also have the code from the [quick start guides](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/quick-starts) available. `get_users_payload.py` and `get_users_payload.rb` allow you to get a sample payload in Python and Ruby for the GET /users endpoint. `get_tweets_payload.py` and `get_tweets_payload.rb` allow you to get GET /tweets endpoint.

## Setting the environment variables
For the code to run for `get_users_sample.py` and `get_tweets_sample.py` you will need to set up the environment variables, you will need to add the following in your terminal:

```bash
export 'CONSUMER_KEY'='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
export 'CONSUMER_SECRET'='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```
