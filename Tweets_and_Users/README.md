# Sample code
This repository contains two sample applications inspired by Python the sample code in the [quick start guides](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/quick-starts).

`get_users_sample.py` allows you to enter in a username, and it will return the location and bio for a user.

`get_users_sample.py` allows you to enter in a tweet id and it will tell you how many likes and retweets a tweet had.

## Setting the environment variables
For this code to run you will need to set up the environment variables, you will need to add the following in your terminal.

```bash
export 'CONSUMER_KEY'='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
export 'CONSUMER_SECRET'='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
```
