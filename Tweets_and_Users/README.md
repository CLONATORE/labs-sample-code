# Sample code

This repository contains two sample applications inspired by the [quick start guides](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/quick-starts). `get_users_sample.py` allows you to enter in a username, and it will return the location and bio for a user. `get_tweets_sample.py` allows you to enter in a Tweet id and will tell you how many likes and retweets a Tweet has had.

We also have the code from the [quick start guides](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/quick-starts) available. `get_users_payload.js`, `get_users_payload.py` and `get_users_payload.rb` allow you to get a sample payload in JavaScript, Python and Ruby for the GET /users endpoint. `get_tweets_payload.js`, `get_tweets_payload.py` and `get_tweets_payload.rb` allow you to use the GET /tweets endpoint.

## Authentication

In order to successfully run the scripts, you must add your Twitter application credentials at the top of each file, where indicated.
